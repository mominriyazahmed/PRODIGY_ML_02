Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project demonstrates how to apply K-means clustering to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. By clustering customers into segments, we can better understand customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

Overview
Customer segmentation is an essential task for businesses to understand different customer groups and develop targeted marketing strategies. In this project, we use the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their purchase patterns, such as total spending, frequency of purchases, and average spend per visit.

Installation
To run the code, you need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib

Dataset
The dataset should contain customer data with features that represent their purchasing behavior, such as Total_Spend, Frequency, Avg_Spend_per_Visit, etc. You can replace these with actual features from your dataset.

Usage
Clone the repository:
Navigate to the project directory:
Run the Python script:

Code Explanation
1. Import Required Libraries
The necessary libraries are imported, including pandas for data handling, NumPy for numerical operations, scikit-learn for K-means clustering, and matplotlib for visualization.

2. Load and Explore the Data
Load the dataset using pandas and perform an initial exploration to understand the structure and contents of the data.

3. Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the data by handling missing values, selecting relevant features, and standardizing the data using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally to the clustering process.

4. Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters
Use the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. The Elbow plot is created by plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters.

5. Apply K-means Clustering
Apply the K-means clustering algorithm with the optimal number of clusters identified in the previous step. The fit_predict method assigns cluster labels to each customer.

6. Analyze and Visualize the Clusters
Visualize the clusters using a scatter plot and analyze the centroids to interpret the different customer segments.


Results
After running the script, you will see a scatter plot showing customer segments and the centroids of each cluster. The clusters represent different customer groups based on their purchasing behavior.
